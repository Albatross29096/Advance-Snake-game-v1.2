# Advance-Snake-game-v1.2

This Snake Game is a modern, feature-rich twist on the classic arcade game. In addition to standard gameplay, it introduces multiple difficulty levels—Normal, Medium, and Hard—where wall generation changes dynamically. The snake can collect energy food for bonus points and bomb food to destroy static walls. At higher levels, teleporting lobe blocks unlock for advanced navigation. The game includes moving wall obstacles, a high score tracker, level progression, and a visually enhanced snake head with glowing eyes and tongue. It also supports pause/resume, mobile playability with touchscreen controls, and a responsive design. All collisions, including with edges, snake body, static/moving walls, food, and teleport blocks, are intelligently handled.
